The 11AM rule by Drippy states approximately this :
- if a new high appears around 11AM, the trend will likely go up and close near HOD
- if a new low appears around 11AM, the trend will likely go down and close near LOD

This indicator allows you to specify the range around 11AM to mark a possible trend and if you want to receive an alert for new HOD and/or new LOD.
To indicate the likeliness of a trend, new HOD will be marked with a green background and a green triangle pointing UP, new LOD will be marked with a red background and a red triangle pointing down, pretty obvious.

next steps:
- add the 2PM rule
- male it a strategy to backtest
- fine tune evertyhting
